# Bitter

##Where a negative response is positive

We wish to be a platform where everything is not roses and sugar, we will share that that needs to be brought out and shown to us, we will speak what we don't want to read, most importantly we will not chase likes, thumbs-up or approval from the community.
**We are Bitter and we will take over the planet.**
